# Create Dashboard Requirements Task

## Purpose

To gather comprehensive requirements for a dashboard or control panel project, creating a Dashboard Requirements Document (DRD) that serves as the foundation for all subsequent design and development work. This task ensures all stakeholder needs, data sources, functional requirements, and technical constraints are captured and documented.

- **Elicit from user**: What decisions will users make based on this dashboard?
- **Elicit from user**: How frequently will users access this dashboard?
- **Elicit from user**: What are the typical user workflows or interaction patterns?

### 2. Data Requirements Analysis

#### 2.1 Data Sources Identification
- **Elicit from user**: What data sources need to be integrated?
  - APIs (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket)
  - Databases (SQL, NoSQL, time-series)
  - Files (CSV, JSON, XML)
  - Real-time streams
  - External services
- **Elicit from user**: What is the data update frequency for each source?
- **Elicit from user**: What are the data access credentials and security requirements?
- **Elicit from user**: Are there any data quality or validation requirements?

#### 2.2 Data Processing Requirements
- **Elicit from user**: What data transformations are needed?
- **Elicit from user**: Are there any calculated fields or derived metrics?
- **Elicit from user**: What data aggregation or filtering is required?
- **Elicit from user**: Are there any data retention or historical data requirements?

### 3. Functional Requirements Definition

#### 3.1 Dashboard Components and Features
- **Elicit from user**: What types of visualizations are needed?
  - Charts (line, bar, pie, scatter, etc.)
  - Tables and grids
  - Gauges and meters
  - Maps and geolocation
  - Text displays and KPIs
- **Elicit from user**: What interactive controls are required?
  - Filters and search
  - Date/time pickers
  - Dropdowns and selectors
  - Toggle switches
  - Buttons and actions
- **Elicit from user**: What layout and organization is preferred?

#### 3.2 User Interaction Requirements
- **Elicit from user**: What drill-down or navigation capabilities are needed?
- **Elicit from user**: Are there export or sharing requirements?
- **Elicit from user**: What customization options should users have?
- **Elicit from user**: Are there any notification or alert requirements?

### 4. Technical Requirements and Constraints

#### 4.1 Performance and Scalability
- **Elicit from user**: How many concurrent users are expected?
- **Elicit from user**: What are the performance expectations (load time, refresh rate)?
- **Elicit from user**: What is the expected data volume?
- **Elicit from user**: Are there any specific browser or device requirements?

#### 4.2 Integration and Infrastructure
- **Elicit from user**: What is the target deployment environment?
- **Elicit from user**: Are there any existing systems that need integration?
- **Elicit from user**: What authentication and authorization requirements exist?
- **Elicit from user**: Are there any compliance or security standards to meet?

### 5. Design and User Experience Preferences

#### 5.1 Visual Design Requirements
- **Elicit from user**: Are there existing brand guidelines or design systems?
- **Elicit from user**: What color schemes or themes are preferred?
- **Elicit from user**: Are there any accessibility requirements?
- **Elicit from user**: What screen sizes and devices need to be supported?

#### 5.2 User Experience Priorities
- **Elicit from user**: What is the priority order for different features?
- **Elicit from user**: Are there any specific usability requirements?
- **Elicit from user**: What level of user training or documentation is expected?

### 6. Project Constraints and Success Criteria

#### 6.1 Timeline and Resources
- **Elicit from user**: What is the desired timeline for completion?
- **Elicit from user**: Are there any budget constraints?
- **Elicit from user**: What resources are available for development and maintenance?

#### 6.2 Success Metrics and Acceptance Criteria
- **Elicit from user**: How will the success of this dashboard be measured?
- **Elicit from user**: What are the acceptance criteria for each major feature?
- **Elicit from user**: Are there any specific performance benchmarks?

### 7. Generate Dashboard Requirements Document

Using the `dashboard-requirements-tmpl.yaml` template, create a comprehensive DRD that includes:

- **Executive Summary**: Project overview and objectives
- **User Requirements**: Target users, use cases, and scenarios
- **Functional Specifications**: Features, components, and interactions
- **Data Requirements**: Sources, processing, and integration needs
- **Technical Requirements**: Performance, security, and infrastructure
- **Design Requirements**: Visual design and user experience specifications
- **Success Criteria**: Metrics, acceptance criteria, and validation methods
- **Project Constraints**: Timeline, budget, and resource limitations

### 8. Validate and Finalize Requirements

#### 8.1 Review with Stakeholders
- Present the completed DRD to stakeholders
- **Elicit feedback**: Are there any missing requirements or concerns?
- **Elicit feedback**: Do the priorities and scope align with expectations?
- Make necessary revisions based on feedback

#### 8.2 Confirm Next Steps
- Verify that all requirements are clearly documented
- Ensure the DRD is ready for the architecture design phase
- Provide guidance on the next workflow step (dashboard architecture)

## Output

A comprehensive Dashboard Requirements Document (DRD) saved as `docs/dashboard-requirements.md` that serves as the foundation for all subsequent design and development activities.
