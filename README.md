# Dashboard Development Framework (BMAD-Adapted)

A systematic, agent-driven framework for building professional control panels and dashboards, adapted from the proven BMAD-METHOD structure.

## Overview

This framework provides a comprehensive workflow for creating high-quality dashboards and control panels that are data-driven, interactive, and professionally implemented. It combines the structured approach of BMAD-METHOD with specialized expertise for dashboard development.

## Key Features

- **Agent-Based Workflow**: Specialized AI agents for each aspect of dashboard development
- **Systematic Process**: Structured workflow from requirements to deployment
- **Professional Quality**: Senior engineer level code standards and implementation
- **Complete Delivery**: Framework drives to fully deployed, working dashboards
- **Proven Structure**: Built on battle-tested BMAD-METHOD architecture

## Architecture

### Core Agents

1. **Dashboard Architect** (`dashboard-architect`) - Technical architecture and system design
2. **UI/UX Designer** (`ui-designer`) - Visual design and user experience
3. **Data Integration Specialist** (`data-integrator`) - Backend data connections and processing
4. **Component Developer** (`component-dev`) - Interactive component implementation
5. **Testing & Validation Specialist** (`dashboard-qa`) - Quality assurance and testing
6. **Dashboard Orchestrator** (`dashboard-orchestrator`) - Workflow coordination and guidance
7. **Dashboard Master** (`dashboard-master`) - Universal task executor for dashboard tasks

```

## Getting Started

### 1. Project Initialization

Start with the **Dashboard Orchestrator** to plan your project:

```bash
# Activate Dashboard Orchestrator
@dashboard-orchestrator

# Get workflow guidance
*guide
```

### 2. Requirements Gathering

Use the **Dashboard Master** to create comprehensive requirements:

```bash
# Activate Dashboard Master
@dashboard-master

# Create dashboard requirements
*requirements
```

This will create a comprehensive Dashboard Requirements Document (DRD) covering:
- User needs and use cases
- Data sources and integration requirements
- Functional specifications
- Technical constraints
- Performance and security requirements

### 3. Architecture Design

Use the **Dashboard Architect** to create technical specifications:

```bash
# Activate Dashboard Architect
@dashboard-architect

# Create dashboard architecture
*create
```

This will generate a detailed architecture document including:
- Technology stack selection
- System architecture design
- Data flow and integration patterns
- Security and performance architecture
- Development guidelines

### 4. UI/UX Design

Use the **UI/UX Designer** for visual design and user experience:

```bash
# Activate UI/UX Designer
@ui-designer

# Create dashboard mockups
*mockup
```

### 5. Component Development

Use the **Component Developer** for implementation:

```bash
# Activate Component Developer
@component-dev

# For each component:
*chart      # Create chart components
*control    # Create control components
*widget     # Create dashboard widgets
*table      # Create data table components
```

### 6. Data Integration

Use the **Data Integration Specialist** for backend connections:

```bash
# Activate Data Integration Specialist
@data-integrator

# Set up data connections
*connect    # Connect data sources
*api        # Set up API integrations
*stream     # Set up real-time data streams
```

### 7. Testing & Validation

Use the **Testing & Validation Specialist** for quality assurance:

```bash
# Activate Testing & Validation Specialist
@dashboard-qa

# Comprehensive testing
*test           # Test dashboard functionality
*performance    # Validate performance
*accessibility  # Test accessibility compliance
*security       # Validate security
```
